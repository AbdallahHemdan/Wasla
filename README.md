## About
> Com is a project to modulate three speech signals using the following scheme: `𝑠(𝑡) = 𝑥1(𝑡) cos 𝜔1𝑡 + 𝑥2(𝑡) cos 𝜔2𝑡 + 𝑥3(𝑡) sin 𝜔2𝑡`, and then perform synchronous demodulation

## Interference between modulated signals

- The Interference was between the low amplitude frequencies which has a very low impact into the final demodulated signals.
- The interference between the high amplitude frequencies was very low and the high amplitude frequencies have the most sound properties.
- So our final results didn't affected by the interference.

- The demodulated signals in (2) was as the original signal because of no shifting in phase (phi = 0)

- In (3), shifting by 10, 30 degrees attenuates the demodulated signals (speech signals) making them lower than the original ones.

- Shifting by 90 degree strongly attenuates the speech signals and it seems like no output speech.
